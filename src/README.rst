Symfony Suggest Bundle
======================

This is a Symfony bundle which enables the popular Select2 component to be used as a drop-in replacement for a standard `entity`, `document` and `choice` fields on a Symfony form.

The main feature of this bundle is that the list of choices is retrieved via a remote ajax call.
